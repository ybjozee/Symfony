I started working with Symfony in 2017 and it's been my primary development language since then. It's my favorite PHP framework because it manages to find a balance between abstraction and magic. I've used it for all kinds of applications - ranging from APIs to CLIs and traditional websites. 

Here's a list of some Symfony projects I have worked on in the last 6 years. 

## [Eliza](https://www.twilio.com/blog/integrate-twilio-whatsapp-business-api-with-symfony-application)

A PHP implementation of the [Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) program integrated with Twilio's [WhatsApp Business API](https://www.twilio.com/messaging/whatsapp).

## [Twilio_MessageLog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/develop-a-symfony-app-using-svelte-and-webpack-encore-to-manage-your-twilio-message-history)

For this project, I built a traditional (monolithic) website to view your Twilio message history. The frontend was built with Svelte, and bundled with Webpack encore while the backend was powered by Symfony.

## [Using custom services in Twig](https://ybjozee.medium.com/today-i-learnt-twig-and-services-fca8d3f05d29)

This project was the result of an interesting challenge I encountered at work. It shows how you can write a service and make it available as a Twig global.

## Test Driven Development

Testing is one of the areas I tend to struggle with. To deal with this, I spent time practicing it. This project serves as a guide (first for me) but for anyone else struggling to integrate testing into their development habits. For this project, I used [Codeception](https://codeception.com/) for writing tests and made sure I went through the red, green, and blue phases of the TDD cycle. 

For the frontend, I used React while I used Go for the backend.

## [Expense management CLI](https://www.twilio.com/blog/build-command-line-tool-symfony)

For this project, I used Symfony to build a CLI for generating expense reports. Additionally, I showed how you can automate this process and have reports sent on a preferred basis.

## [Symfony and Inky](https://www.twilio.com/blog/use-inky-and-sendgrid-to-send-beautiful-emails)

For this project, I used [Inky](https://get.foundation/emails/docs/inky.html) to generate beautiful HTML email templates.

## [Managing multiple interfaces with Symfony](https://ybjozee.medium.com/today-i-learnt-how-to-inject-multiple-instances-of-an-interface-in-a-service-1488cf7836bd)

For this project, I wanted to learn how I could implement a SOLID pattern in my Symfony project. The key to this was tagging an interface and injecting the array of objects implementing this interface into a service to manage further execution.
